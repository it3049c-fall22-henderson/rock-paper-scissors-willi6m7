17 out of 20.

## Team Reflection:
- Where did you encounter struggles today, and what did you do to deal with it?
Did most of it without a hitch, but ran into issues right at the end with getting the string equalities to play nice when determining a winner. Although the rest of the code is working, three of the thirty-one unit tests are not passing - I can't seem to get them to pass.
